# Overview
This project implements a pathfinding algorithm to solve sliding puzzles on frictionless ice surfaces, commonly seen in video games. 
The goal is to move from the start position (S) to the finish position (F) while navigating around rocks (0). 
Due to the frictionless surface, the player slides in the chosen direction until they hit a wall or an obstacle, making the reachability and shortest-path computation different from standard pathfinding problems.
